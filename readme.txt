Easy-to-use, ajax-powered plugin to edit summaries/lists of a group of posts and/or pages that you collect together in a 'book'.

== Description ==

This plugin builds 4 boxes by which you can easily manage **'Books'**. Books are containers for **'Chapters'** chosen among **Posts, Custom Posts or Pages** that you add to a Book. You can also remove and/or sort them (straightforward with Ajax). Finally in the box **'Summaries'** the plugin generates a **custom shortcode** ( e.g. **[sommaire-chapitres livre=3]** ) to display a list of links to your chapters anywhere you like. It is easy to define your own styles for the summaries!

== Installation ==

1. Upload `chapters.zip` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. You can now start to manage your chapters in the 'Chapters' tab of 'Settings' panel.
4. Please find extended help at http://www.3m3.fr/chapters
